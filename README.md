I hate losing March Madness pools as much as I love March Madness. And I've lost a LOT of pools. You probably wrestle with the same annual problem as I do, namely: where on the chalky / upsetty continuum should my bracket sit?

Ultimately, what matters is value. And since our goal is presumably to win money, value is best measured as ROI or EV. Given that, we need to figure out how to determine which picks -- or really, which set of 63 picks -- provides the best return.
